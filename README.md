**Hey! I'm Aman**

I'm currently a student at USC pursuing a BS Quantitative Biology and an MS in Applied Data Science. For a while, I've been super interested in technological approaches to bettering health, specifically in the areas of genetics, drug discovery, physical health, and mental health. I made this recently to showcase some of the things I've been working on!

Some of these include levarging LLMs or a variety of predictive machine learning models, or even leveraging something novel like extended reality as something that can benefit physical and mental well-being through simulations and gamifications.

Aside from that, I love to play guitar, exercise, play games, and write, and I'm always eager bond with people with similar interests!

Feel free to shoot me an email at aasharma@usc.edu if you'd like to collaborate on something or even just chat!

Hope you have a great day and kill it out there with whatever you do!
